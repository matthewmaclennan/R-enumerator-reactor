#reaction enumerator
#
#These (sets of) programs will react starting materials by breaking and making bonds, 
#according to certain boundaries and rates, which will be tunable.
#SMILES notation will be used based on the programs for enumerating 
#cycles and acyclic originators.
#
#
#Enumerating this way will be tricky because now electron flow will need to be considered top 
#priority, complicating SMILES notations. Electron flow gives rise to H patching.
#
#The initial focus will be on enumerating the (types of) molecules which are formed upon bond breaking and bond formation.
#
#A key feature will be the probability ranking of enumerated species. Generated species will be ranked in terms of their 
#relative stabilities. This will be useful in trimming the enumeration results from "all species" to "stable species". 
#For instance, homolytic bond cleavage appears to be less favourable in most systems compared to heterolytic bond cleavage.
#Therefore, a simple ranking system could be based on bond polarities and their relationship to reactivity (most or least 
#likely to react).
#
#All possible products within (2 electron reason) will be considered and the reaction pathways by which such molecules could
#arise will be justified a posteriori. This is important physically because the state of the early universe was such that many
#chemical processes that do not occur spontaneously in the universe's current state may have been spontaneous. In fact, a great 
#many chemical reactions and species may have been easily formed with almost equal probability, further justifying an 
#enumerative approach.
